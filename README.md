# Alternative Splicing Simulator

This project is aimed to simulate the process of alternative splicing. So you can create a sequence with sequence_generator then annotate the exons with the exons_annotator. 
After that you could use exon_extractor to remove an exon and, to finalize the process, create the reads with reads_generator.

## How to use each script:

```
  ./sequence_generator.py 2 MB > sequence.txt
```

In this case **2** is the size of the sequence and **MB** is the unit. In the script file there is more explanation. The output is **sequence.txt**

```
  ./exons_annotator sequence.txt > annotation.txt
```

In this case **sequence.txt** is your sequence file and **annotation.txt** is the output. 


```
  ./exon_extractor annotation.txt B sequence.txt > sequence_without_exon_B.txt
```

In this case **sequence.txt** is your sequence file and **annotation.txt** is the annotation file created by **exons_annotator** script. **sequence_withou_exon_b.txt** is the output. 

```
  ./reads_generator sequence.txt 75 100000
```
In this case **sequence.txt** is the sequence that you want to use to create the reads (As these one generated by rna-seq). **75** is the length of each read and **100000** are how many reads the script will create randomly.

## TODO

- [ ] Create an pipeline whose includes all scripts and execute them sequentially
- [ ] Implement the other kinds of splicing alternative (This scripts only implement **Exon Skipping**)
- [ ] Create web services of these scripts (Maybe)
- [ ] Create an web interface whose use these web services (Maybe)
